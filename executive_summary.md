# Executive Summary: AI Security Testing Framework

## 🎯 **What We Built**
A Python wrapper that automates security testing for AI models, detecting vulnerabilities like prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data extraction attempts.

---

## 📋 **For Executives (30-second pitch)**

**The Problem:** AI models are vulnerable to attacks that can make them reveal sensitive information or behave dangerously.

**My Solution:** Automated security testing that runs 9 different attack scenarios in minutes, providing a clear security score and risk assessment.

**The Value:** 
- **Speed**: Automated vs manual testing (minutes vs hours)
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive vulnerability detection
- **Reliability**: Consistent, repeatable testing
- **Cost**: Open-source, minimal infrastructure needed

---

## 🔧 **For Technical Leaders (1-minute explanation)**

**Architecture:**
- Python wrapper around PromptFoo CLI
- Subprocess execution with error handling
- JSON/YAML parsing for flexible output
- Pydantic models for type safety

**Key Features:**
- 3 attack types: Prompt injection, jailbreaking, PII extraction
- Comprehensive metrics and analysis
- Risk level assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Easy integration with existing systems

**Usage:**
```python
wrapper = PromptfooWrapper()
results = wrapper.run_security_tests()
print(f"Security Score: {results['security_analysis']['overall_security_score']}")
```

## 👨‍💻 **For Developers (2-minute technical overview)**

**What it does:**
1. **Executes** `promptfoo eval` commands via subprocess
2. **Parses** JSON/YAML output from PromptFoo CLI
3. **Extracts** metrics (success rates, attack types, response analysis)
4. **Analyzes** results for security vulnerabilities
5. **Provides** comprehensive reporting and recommendations

**Key Components:**
- `PromptfooWrapper`: Main wrapper class
- `TestResult`: Individual test result model
- `EvaluationMetrics`: Comprehensive metrics model
- `AttackType`: Enum for different attack categories

**Error Handling:**
- CLI installation validation
- Timeout handling
- Configuration validation
- Graceful failure modes
