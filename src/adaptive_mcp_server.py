Adaptive MCP Server Module

This module implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides adaptive AI security testing capabilities.
It handles:
- MCP server implementation for AI model integration
- Adaptive security testing workflows
- Real-time model interaction and testing
- Dynamic test case execution and analysis

Key functionalities:
- Serve as an MCP server for AI model testing
- Execute adaptive security tests
- Provide real-time testing capabilities
- Integrate with various AI models through MCP
