## 🎯 Key Talking Points for Your Presentation

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"Today I'm demonstrating an AI security testing agent that doesn't just detect threats - it learns from them and adapts its defenses in real-time. This is the future of AI security."*

### **Business Value (1 minute)**
*"This system prevents millions in potential financial losses while building customer trust. Watch as it goes from vulnerable to fortified in real-time."*

### **Technical Innovation (2 minutes)**
*"The key innovation is adaptive learning. Each attack attempt teaches the system new patterns, which it uses to generate better defensive strategies."*

### **Real-world Impact (1 minute)**
*"This isn't theoretical - these are real attack patterns we're defending against. The system learns from each attempt and gets stronger over time."*

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **If imports fail:**
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/Users/micah/pegasi-takehome-1/src"
```

### **If dependencies missing:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **If dashboard doesn't start:**
```bash
# Check if port 8501 is available
lsof -i :8501
# Kill if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### **If server doesn't start:**
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is available
lsof -i :8000
# Kill if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```
